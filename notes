	if argc != 2, exit(failure).
Open file - (fopen?):
	if open fails, exit(failure).

	parse instructions and perform operations accordngly eg calling various functions.
	if instruction is invalid, exit(failure).
	Valid instructions:
		- push <int>

Use getline() to read line into a buffer
Use strspn to skip lines consisting entirely of whitespace characters
Use strtok to break the lines into words. Only the first 3 words are needed.
